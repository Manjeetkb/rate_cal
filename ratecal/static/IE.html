<h1>Ionization Energy</h1>
<p>Ionization energy (IE) is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the gaseous atom or ion.
    It measures the difficulty of removing electron in other words the strength by which an electron is bounded.
    IE can be computed as the difference between the total energies for the
ground state of the molecule in ionic state to the neutral molecule.
$${\rm IE} = {\rm E_{0}(N-1)} - {\rm E_{0}N}$$
IE calculated by this way, as from above equation, is often much more accurate since systematic
errors cancel and the difference of energies from correlated quantum mechanical techniques
give even more accurate results than might be obtained by experimental methods.
IE values are of great interest to SIFT-MS experiments as these values help us to determine
whether a reaction of $NO^{+}$ and $O_{2}^{+}$ ions to the analyte molecule occur by charge transfer or
not. The reactions involving charge exchange mass spectra is the net result of the
energy-dependent scheme operating at fixed internal energy (over a small range of internal
energies). The exothermicity of the reaction is determined by the recombination energy of the
reactant ions less than the ionization energy of the molecule. It has been observed analytically
that low energy charge exchange raises the difference in the mass spectrum of most
isobaric compounds. In addition to this, charge exchange spectra as a result becomes much
simpler. The charge exchange reaction with $NO^{+}$ ion to the volatile organic compounds is an ideal
example. IE of NO is 9.3 eV, although, the effective recombination energy of $NO^{+}$ ion under CI conditions
appears to be considerably lower. Organic molecules having IE values lower than NO undergo
extensive charge exchange reactions. $NO^{+}$ ion reacts with many aromatic organic
compounds through charge exchange or adduct formation. Experimental results have shown that aromatic
compounds having IE higher than ~8.7 eV promote adduct ion formation otherwise dominant charge
exchange reactions will be preferred. Above verdict can be applicable to other class of compounds as well.
Results have shown that under CI condition, $NO^{+}$ ions have a successful charge exchange reaction
energy window with the molecules having IE ~ 8.7 eV. Another popular reagent ion commonly used in SIFT-MS
experiments for application point of view is $O_{2}^{+}$ ion. Although, the usefulness of $O_{2}^{+}$ is
limited due to high IE of $O_{2}$ molecule (~ 12 eV) that may deposit a large amount of energy to the product
ion and promote large fragmentation upon reaction with volatile organic compounds. However, most organic
molecules are found to have IE values well below the IE of $O_{2}$ molecule and proceed
through charge exchange reactions. This suggests that all the
molecules which are not quantified by $NO^{+}$ may undergo charge exchange reactions with
$O_{2}^{+}$ ion.
