<h1>Basics of Collision in Gas-Phase</h1>

<h2>Ion-molecule Collision Theory</h2>
<p>Ion-molecule reactions involve the collision of ions (positive and negative) with neutral molecule
give rise to chemical reaction in which at least one chemical bond is ruptured or one new bond is formed.
Many possible outcomes as a result of ion-molecule collision include charge transfer, atom abstraction, complex formation,
collision induced dissociation, collision induced ionization and ionization etc. There are certain factors on which the the
reaction outcome depends which are chemical and physical properties of the reactants, their relative velocity and impact parameter
of their trajectories. Further, ion-molecule reactions can be classified based on the interaction energy involved in the collision are
low energy and higher energy. Low energy reaction (less than 10 eV) are some of the most important reactions occur in
upper atmosphere, radiation chemistry, ion-loses and electric discharge. High energy collisions are typically impulsive and
involve short-range intermolecular forces and are direct and fast reactions. We will focus here in low energy ion-molecule collision
strongly dominated by long-range interactions and ofter proceed at capture collision. A dipole is induced by the ion on the neutral
molecule and due to this ion-molecule reactions have very large collision cross-section. Generally, such reactions are
independent of temperature and activation energy usually found to be zero and reaction occurs at almost every collision.
</p>
<h2>Collision Cross-section</h2>
<p> The fundamental quantity that measures the probability or likelihood of ion-molecule reaction is the microscopic
total reaction cross-section $\sigma_{R} (v)$. Collision cross-section is defined as the area around a particle
in which the center of another particle must be in order for the collision to occur. If two molecules A and B are to react,
they must come into contact with sufficient force such that chemical bonds in the reactant side break in order to have
a reaction. For an effective collision, there must be sufficient energy (KE) to initiate a reaction known as activation
energy. For molecules A and B, when distance between their
nuclei $(r_{AB})$ is less than the sum of their radii $(r_{A}+r_{B})$ then the collision will occur.
For the reaction to occur, necessary conditions are:
<ul>
    <li>The molecules must collide for the reaction to happen.</li>
    <li>Collision must possess sufficient energy to break bonds in the reactant side.</li>
    <li>They must be in proper orientation.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>Rate Coefficient</h2>
During the course of the reaction shown below, reactants A and B are consumed while the concentration of product
AB increases. The reaction rate can be determined by measuring how fast the concentration of A or B decreases, or
by how fast the concentration of AB increases.
$${A + B = AB}$$
A rate law is an expression which relates that rate of a reaction to the rate constant and the concentrations of
the reactants. A rate constant, k, is a proportionality constant for a given reaction. The general rate law is
usually expressed as:
$${Rate = k[A]^{s}[B]^{t}}$$
The factors which affect the rate of a reaction are temperature, concentration etc.
Ion-molecule reactions are characterized by a long-range attractive force between the charge
on the ion and the dipole induced by the ion on the neutral molecule. Ion-molecule reactions which occur
with zero activation energy are quite fast, exothermic and the rate
coefficient of such reactions is equal to the 'capture' or 'collision' rate coefficient. Because the long-range
attractive force 'captures' the approaching reactants and can bring them into a favourable trajectory for the reaction to
occur.
As per average dipole orientation (ADO) theory the magnitude of rate coefficient is determined
by the physical properties of the reactants i.e. dipole moment $\mu_{D}$ and polarizability $\alpha$.
Ion-molecule reactions of the type mentioned above are quite common in PTR-MS/SIFT-MS drift tubes.
In the PTR-MS drift tube, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions in buffer gas (air or He) are allowed to react
with the analyte molecule R and undergo proton transfer reaction as follows:
$${H_{3}O^{+} + R \longrightarrow RH^{+} + H_{2}O}.$$
Where concentration [R] of the analyte compound in the above exothermic reaction can be
measured from the following equation:
$$[{\rm R}] = \frac{1}{\rm k\tau} \frac{[{\rm RH}^{+}]}{[{\rm H}_3{\rm O}^{+}]_o}\,,$$
where $[H_{3}\rm O^{+}]_o$ is the density of $H_{3}O^{+}$ ions without the reactant neutrals in buffer gas and
[RH<sup>+</sup>] is the density of the product ion.
k is the rate coefficient of the reaction and ${\tau}$ is the reaction time (the reaction time
it takes for the reagent ion to travel from the point where it is first mixed with the analyte
to the end of the drift tube beyond which reaction essentially stops) for the reagent ions traversing the drift
tube usually ${\sim 100~\mu}$s. The rate coefficient k can be calculated from ADO theory which further depends on the
dipole moment and polarizability of the reactant (already mentioned above).
