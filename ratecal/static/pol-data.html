<h1>Electronic Polarizability</h1>
<p>The electric polarizability measures the ease with which
the distortion in the distribution of electron density about an atom or a group in
response to an external electric field. When this happens, the field induces a dipole
moment in the atom ($\mu = \alpha $E, where $\mu$ is the magnitude of the induced dipole
moment, $\alpha$ is a constant called polarizability tensor, and E is the strength of electric
field). The strength of the dispersion forces, the weakness of intermolecular forces,
largely relies on the polarizability of the electrons. In other words, polarizability
determines how tightly electrons are held by the nucleus. For example, unshared
electron pairs possess higher polarizability than those shared by covalent bonding.
This means farther the electrons from the nucleus, the less tightly they are held, and
the greater their polarizability will be and true contrariwise. The polarizability can
also be represented as the measure of the volume of an atom. Polarizabilities can be formulated as derivatives of the
dipole moment with respect to the incident electric field.
$$\alpha_{ij} = \left( \frac{\partial \mu_{i}}{\partial E_{j}} \right)_{E\rightarrow0}$$
Polarizability is a property of matter and it is considered as the ability to form instantaneous dipoles. Dipole moment
and polarizability are the primary quantities that are used in ion-molecule collisions using ADO theory.
