<h1>Proton Affinity</h1>
<p>Proton affinity (PA) of a molecule is defined as the negative enthalpy change of the reaction.
Since the acceptance of a proton is an exothermic process, the PA is a positive
quantity. PA values as it serves as a guide to the possible route of proton transfer processes.
Proton transfer reactions play an important role in analytical chemistry and biochemistry.
    In chemical ionization mass spectrometry, both positive and negative ions are operated.
One of the most commonly used reagent ions is $H_{3}O^{+}$ ion. The proton transfer reaction (PTR) with $H_{3}O^{+}$ ions is
effective only when the proton affinity of the acceptor molecule is higher than the $H_{2}O$
molecule. If the molecule possesses higher PA than $H_{2}O$, the PTR will be exothermic and
favored thermodynamically. PA of the reaction
$$\rm A + \rm H^{+} \rightarrow \rm AH^{+}\,,$$
is defined as the negative of the reaction enthalpy at 298.15K, and hence $({\it T}$: temperature,
R: ideal gas constant)

$$\rm PA = -\Delta H = -\Delta E+ \rm R \it T\,.$$
The energy of a non-linear poly-atomic molecule can be approximated as
$$\rm E(\it T) = \rm E_{rot}(\it T) + \rm E_{trans}(\it T) + \rm ZPE + {E'}_{vib}(\it T) + \rm E_{ele}\,,$$
    where ZPE stands for zero point energy of the normal modes. From statistics mechanics,
    E$_{\rm rot}(T)$ and E$_{\rm trans}(T)$ each contributes $\frac{3}{2}$R $T$.
    The quantity E'$_{\rm vib}(T)$ is usually less than 1 kcal/mol at room temperature,
    which is much less than the experimental error, and neglected as compared to ZPE.
    In this formalism, ground state energy of proton contribution is zero. Hence

$$\rm PA = -\Delta \rm E_{ele}-\Delta \rm ZPE + \frac{5}{2}R\it T\,,$$

where, $\Delta \rm E_{ele}$ and $\Delta \rm ZPE$ are the change in the electronic energy and change
    in zero point energy to the protonated and neutral molecule. The last term in  is the contribution
    from E$_{\rm rot}(T)$, E$_{\rm trans}(T)$ and R$T$ to the equation.


One can expect that a molecule can have more than one site of protonation depending on the electronegativity
of the individual atoms of a molecule. PA value at one site can be different
from the value at another site within a complex molecule. Also, protonation may occur on
the sites other than the thermodynamically favorable sites.

Experimental data of PA for many compounds has been listed by

PA values for cork-taint and off-flavour molecules in wine computed using DFT calculations
are listed <a href="IE-cork.pdf">here</a>. These values have been obtained by
Gaussian16 code.
