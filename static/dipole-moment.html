<h1>Electric Dipole Moment</h1>
<p> When two charges of opposite sign are separated by a small distance then the system formed called a dipole.
    Dipole moment arises from the difference in electronegativity. It measures the polarity of a molecule.
    Dipole moment of a molecule influences the interaction between the molecule and its neighbour. The molecule with
    a complicated structure individual dipoles are computed and vectors are added on the assumption that vectorial
    additivity of the dipole moment is valid. The interaction of an electronic charge distribution $\rho(r)$ with an
    electric potential $\phi(r)$ gives an energy contribution.
    $$E = \int \rho(r) \phi(r) dr$$
    For uniform electric field which is so at molecular level, electric energy can be expanded in multiple expansion:
    $$E = q\phi - \mu F - \frac{1}{2}QF' -...\text{and so on} $$
    Where charge q represents monopole, $\mu$ and Q represent dipole and quadrupole respectively.
    The dipole moment can also be written as first derivative of the electric
    energy w.r.t. an external field. Dipole moment is the important in the calculation of rate coefficient of ion-molecule
    collision reactions using ADO theory.<br>
Dipole moment calculated experimentally <a href="Thermophysical_Properties_of_Chemicals.pdf">here</a> for number
    of molecules.
<a href="lenge's_handbook_of_chemistry.pdf">Lange's Handbook of Chemistry</a> is another source of dipole moment values.
</p>
<br>
A handful source of dipole moment can be NIST database for
    <a href="https://cccbdb.nist.gov/diplistx.asp">experimental</a> and
<a href="https://cccbdb.nist.gov/dipole1.asp">theoretical</a> values as obtained by ab-initio and DFT calculations.
<br>
<br>
Dipole moment for cork-taint and off-flavour molecules in wine computed by using DFT calculations is listed
<a href="dipole-moment-cork-taint.pdf">here</a>.
These values have been obtained by QuantumEspresso and Gaussian codes.
