<h1>Theory of Ion-molecule Reactions</h1>
<p> Mass spectrometry has provided great deal of information of ion-molecule reactions including extensive thermodynamic
    information about ions and molecules which include standard enthalpy of ion formation, electron affinities, ionization energies
    and proton affinities of neutral molecules. Ion-molecule reactions are among the fastest chemical reactions because
    the electrostatic interaction between ionic charge and polar molecule draws them (ion and molecule) together at long range.
    The interaction energy as a result is large enough to overcome intrinsic energy barrier to chemical change. As a consequences,
    these reactions often proceed through zero or very small activation energy at room temperature. The reaction rate coefficients
    will be determined by collision rate and found to be of the order of ~1*10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

<h2> Type of Ion-molecule Reactions in Drift Tube</h2>
<p>Ion-molecule reactions are of particular interest that can provide a great deal of information on the nature
of ion chemistry occurring in PTR-MS/SIFT-MS drift tubes. In CI, the reactions between
the ions and the molecules can lead to a variety of consequences such as simple electron transfer,
proton transfer, collision association, condensation, clustering, and fragment accompanied
by extensive chemical bond re-disposition in both the molecule and the ion.
$$\rm AH^{+}+\rm B \longrightarrow \rm BH^{+}+\rm A\,,  \qquad \text{Proton transfer}$$
$$\rm A^{+}+\rm BH \longrightarrow \rm B^{+}+\rm AH\,, \qquad \text{Hydride tranfer}$$
$$\rm A^{\pm}+\rm B \longrightarrow \rm B^{\pm}+ \rm A\,, \qquad \text{Electron tranfer}$$

$$\rm A^{+}+\rm B +\rm Z \longrightarrow \rm BA^{+}+\rm Z\,, \qquad \text{Adduct formation}$$

$$
\rm A^{+}+\rm B +\rm Z \rightarrow \rm [AB^{+}]^{*} \longrightarrow AB^{+} \rightarrow \rm C^{+}+\rm D\,, \\ \qquad \text{Condensation reaction}
$$
 In PTR-MS, proton transfer reactions from
gaseous Br&#8709;nsted acids to neutral molecules as in reaction (1) follows. Hydride transfer
    reaction is also quite common under chemical ionization. Electron transfer (charge transfer)
from ion to the neutral molecule takes place only when
the molecule B possesses IE less than the IE of the A in the reaction (3). However, the dissociative electron transfer is quite possible at higher IEs.

When the proton transfer
reaction is exceedingly exothermic, internal energy appearing in the protonated product
will be enough to cause dissociative proton transfer (AH<sup>+*</sup> ). This is normally seen in
    dissociative electron-transfer reactions, although, the product ions again offer a signature of
the reactant molecule so that these types of reactions also present a handful of information
for the analysis of gases by chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The reaction (4) proceeds through a
third body Z to prevent dissociation of adduct BA<sup>+</sup>
by removing some energy. The condensation reaction (5) involving two reactants collisionally
stabilized and relatively a long-lived collision complex. In the absence of such
stabilization it decomposes, at least in part, to products different from the reactants and
yields C<sup>+</sup> and D as shown in reaction (5). The bi-molecular IMRs ranging from reaction
(1) to (5) are often very fast, exothermic, and occur at every collision. Which makes
them useful for an efficient ionization of targeted molecules in mass spectrometry.</p>
<h2> Rate Coefficients in Ion-molecule Collision</h2>
<p> The rate coefficients of ion-molecule reactions that proceed without activation energy can not be obtained by
    Arrhenius equation. Although, rate coefficients of such exothermic reactions is given by the capture collision
    cross-section. Several theories are
available that allow calculation of the capture or collision
rate coefficient for an ion-molecule collision. According to the most popular theory, the average dipole
orientation (ADO) theory, the magnitude of the rates is determined by the physical properties of the reactants: the
polarizability and permanent dipole of the reacting molecule.</p>
