<h1>Mass Spectrometry Basics</h1>




<h2>Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry</h2>
<p>The most important point in the identification and quantification using mass spectrometry lies in the formation of the
    ions to be analyzed. The ionization process is vital as it may largely affect the mass spectrum due to invariably large fragmentation as
    in electron impact (EI) ionization, photon impact and field ionization.
    Chemical ionization (CI) is called soft ionization, a technique developed during the 1960s, where a reagent
gas is ionized by electron impact at high reagent gas pressure. The resulting product ions of
ion-molecule reactions between the reagent gas ions and reagent gas neutrals are allowed
to react with the analyte molecule via proton transfer or hydride transfer reactions. Proton
transfer reaction will be favored if the PA of the sample analyte molecules is higher than
that of the reagent gas and hydride transfer will be dominated if the PA of the sample analyte
    molecules is lower than that of the reagent gas. CI, in particular plays a significant
role in minimizing the fragmentation to a larger extent, which interns helps to minimize the
complexity in the mass spectra. CI generates stable charged molecules and the reactions
are low in energy as compared to EI method. CI is very useful to elucidate the molecular ions of unknowns and is
    often the ionization method of choice for quantitative mass
spectroscopy via ion monitoring. More precisely, CI provides solutions in molecular mass determination, structure elucidation and
identification and quantification.</p>
<h2>PTR-MS</h2>
<p>Direct injection mass spectrometry (DIMS) based techniques such as PTR-MS is an established method
    for the rapid and non-invasive online monitoring of VOCs. PTR-MS uses the ability of ion (usually H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>)
    to transfer its proton (PA H<sub>2</sub>O=165.5 kcal/mol) to any analyte in air that has higher PA than water. PTR-MS
uses CI and the concept of swarm type technique of flow tube in combination with flow
drift tube for determining the concentration of trace gases. PTR-MS was first introduced by
Werner Lindinger and his collaborators in 1995 as a technique for accurate quantification
of the densities of neutral components by measuring the primary and product ion signals in
the ion-molecule reaction using H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ion in PTR-MS analysis.
The gases analyte sample containing the VOCs to be analyzed (for example, ambient air)
is sampled directly into the PTR mass spectrometer without any sample preparation. The
analyte sample must have PAs higher than that of water for proton transfer reaction to occur. This is an analytic technique that uses the kinetics of the reaction or gas calibration
standards to determine the concentration of unknown compounds.

PTR-MS is widely used in different areas such as atmospheric, Chemistry, food science and Biology. The primary
strength of PTR-MS, especially in food science, is its ability to monitor rapid changes
in trace volatile concentrations (with an ultimate time resolution of 100 ms) within the
complex chemical matrix of food i.e. it has the ability to investigate the dynamic release
of aromas and therefore rapid changes in composition. PTR-MS has been widely
used in the trace gas analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
    The advantage of using H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is that it does not react with most of the air constituents, but shows effective proton transfer reactions with analyte molecules.
as their proton affinities values are lower than that of H<sub>2</sub>O, but shows effective proton transfer reactions with analyte i.e. VOCs. Moreover,
most of the the VOCs fall in the range having PAs larger than that of water except smaller alkanes, ethene and acetylene. Other than H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ion,
    NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ion is also used in specific application where the the PA of the molecules is very high and ionization with
    H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> may results to fragmentation. Only the molecules having PA higher than NH<sub>3</sub> (203.6 kcal/mol) show effective proton transfer reactions.

<h2>SIFT-MS</h2>
<p>
    SIFT-MS is a method for the real-time quantification of the trace gases developed by Spanel
and Smith in 1996. SIFT-MS, also called ion-swarm technique provides the means of extracting kinetic information
    from relatively fast reactions of ions (positive or negative) with atoms and molecules under thermalized temperature conditionsover a wide range of temperature (80 K - 600 K).
Recently, SIFT-MS has been developed as a very sensitive analytical technique for the analyses of VOCs with a typical detection limit as low as parts-per-trillion level
by volume range (pptv). In this technique, real-time and quantitative analysis is achieved
by applying precisely controlled soft chemical ionization and eliminating the requirement
of sample preparation, pre-concentration, and chromatography. SIFT-MS was a follow-up
technique of SIFT developed by Adams and Smith in the mid-seventies. SIFT-MS in turn
was an extension of the early work of adapting flow tubes to investigate ion-molecule reactions begun in the late 1960s by Ferguson and collaborators [58].

    The chemistry of SIFT-MS and SIFT thought to be opposite to each other, although core methodology remains
same. In SIFT, kinetic parameters of ion-molecule reactions are derived from the known
reactant concentration while in SIFT-MS, the concentration of the analyte molecules is
determined from known kinetic parameters. Ultra-soft chemical ionization in SIFT-MS
allows it to provide unparalleled selectivity among other mass spectrometric techniques.
Another factor that makes SIFT-MS technology unique to other techniques is the reagent
(or precursor) ions which are well characterized, mass-selective and undergo known ion-
molecule reactions with the analytes. H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, NO<sup>+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> are frequently
    used in SIFT-MS instrument.
    These ions react with analyte VOCs
and inorganic gases in very well controlled ion-molecule reactions, but they do not react
with the major components of air (N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and Ar). This enables SIFT-MS to analyze air
at trace and ultra-trace levels without pre-concentration.
